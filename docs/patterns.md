#Design Patterns

1. Iterator
    * Walking a data structure
2. Adapter
    * Make an object conform to the shape(contract) of another object
3. Null Object / Special Case
    * Missing / Default behaviour handling
4. Specification
    * Does an object meet a criteria
5. Decorator
    * Extend the behaviour of an existing component without modifying the code for that component
6. Abstract Factory
    * Creation using contracts as the return values
7. Composite
    * Treat a set of items as if they were a singular item
8. Gateway
    * Single point of access to a specific piece of functionality
