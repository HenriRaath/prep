#Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (High Cohesion)
2. TDA (Tell Don't Ask)
3. Encapsulate what varies (need to be able to identify what stays the same)
4. Code to contracts not implementations (decreases coupling and fragility as the system is extended)
5. Favour composition over inheritance
6. Fight to find the higher level problem (abstraction)
7. Open Closed Principle
